## Instructions
- Download the repository;
- Download MongoDB on your computer (preferably with MongoDB compass);
- Connect to MongoDB on localhost, port 27017 (the default one);
- Run the script on 'Script_PopulateDB' named 'populateDB.js';
- Run 'npm install' on root directory to install the dependencies;
- Run Node.js command 'node app' on root directory;
- Access 'localhost:3000' to use the app.

## About the code

- Many of the codes here could be optimized(looking at you timeouts), but unfortunately I'm not very knowledgeable with async and promises;
- The only js and css used together with my own is [Flickity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/), an API used for carousels;
- The MVC architecture was respected and used in most of the project.
- The project is not 100% functional due to a problem in the catalog controller while calling a model method and other mongodb connection object issues;
- The data to be used in the APIs(popularity and % of prices) were not found in the database, therefore the queries used were similar to the 'get' method.
